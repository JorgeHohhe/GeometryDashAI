# Geometry Dash Artificial Intelligence

An AI that plays Geometry Dash using the NEAT python module.

# Instructions

You can run mainGD.py with NEATconfig.txt in same folder and watch an AI start training itself to play the game.

# Videos and Progression

   ✔ Make the initial idea of the game - https://youtu.be/FmS_iiCMI6M
   
   ✔ Train an AI to jump only spikes - https://youtu.be/bkRTJ6H2T3A
   
   Note: In generation 0, a neural network was generated that was good enough to jump all the spikes
         
   ✔ Train an AI to jump spikes and blocks - https://youtu.be/tO9bRK6HNVg
   
   Note: The AI was unable in 200 generations to generate a neural network capable of jumping spikes and blocks of the "normal" size (75x75 pixels), but in a few generations (15) it was able to skip smaller spikes (50x50 pixels) and blocks (75x75 pixels).
         
   ☐ Improve block physics.
   
   ☐ Review the code to generate better learning for AI to make it jump spikes and blocks 75x75 pixels.
   
   ☐ and more.
