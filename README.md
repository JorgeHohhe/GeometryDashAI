# Geometry Dash Artificial Intelligence

An AI that plays Geometry Dash using the NEAT python module.

# Instructions

You can run main.py and watch an AI start training itself to play the game.

# Videos and Progression

   ✔ Make the initial idea of the game - 
   ✔ Train an AI to jump only spikes - 
         Note: In generation 0, a neural network was generated that was good enough to jump all the spikes
   ✔ Train an AI to jump spikes and blocks - 
         Note: The AI was unable in 200 generations to generate a neural network capable of jumping spikes and blocks of the "normal" size (75x75 pixels), but in a few generations it was able to skip smaller spikes (50x50 pixels) and blocks (75x75 pixels).
   ☐ Improve block physics.
   ☐ Review the code to generate better learning for AI to make it jump spikes and blocks 75x75 pixels.
   ☐ and more.
